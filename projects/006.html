        <h2>Background</h2>

<p>A self initiated experimental project. Where I intended on getting a better understanding of how maps are designed. This project by no means polished. </p>

<p>The current MARTA Rail map consists of a traditional layout that mimics an abstract form of Atlanta, Georgia. </p>

<p>The problem was reading the map required viewing the station names in a sideways manner. </p>

<p>Enter my experiment the goal was to attempt to re-design the map with an isometric view.</p>
